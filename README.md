# Developer Platform

A Crossplane-first developer control plane for Kubernetes that enables declarative infrastructure management with AI integration capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

This platform uses **Crossplane as the foundational infrastructure abstraction layer**. The architecture enables:

- Declarative infrastructure provisioning through Crossplane compositions
- State synchronization from Kubernetes resources to external systems
- AI agent integration through standardized APIs
- Developer-friendly abstractions over complex infrastructure

## Core Principles

### Crossplane-First
- All infrastructure provisioning and lifecycle management handled by Crossplane
- Custom compositions define platform capabilities
- Providers handle cloud resource management
- XRDs define platform abstractions

### Domain-Driven Structure
- Services grouped by business capability, not technical hierarchy
- Clear domain boundaries with well-defined interfaces
- Each domain can evolve independently

### State Synchronization
- Single sync operator watches multiple Kubernetes resource types
- Syncs resource state to central database for external consumption
- Enables AI agents and external systems to query platform state

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Why Crossplane-First?
- **Declarative Infrastructure**: All infrastructure defined as code through compositions
- **Provider Ecosystem**: Leverage existing Crossplane providers for cloud resources
- **Kubernetes Native**: Infrastructure resources are Kubernetes resources
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new capabilities through new compositions

### Why Domain-Driven Structure?
- **Team Ownership**: Teams can own entire business domains
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between domains
- **Independent Evolution**: Domains can be developed and deployed independently
- **Business Alignment**: Structure reflects business capabilities

### Why Single Sync Operator?
- **Simplicity**: One operator handles all resource types
- **Efficiency**: Shared database connection and sync logic
- **Consistency**: Unified approach to state synchronization
- **Maintainability**: Single point of control for external state management

### What We Deliberately Excluded
- **Observability**: Using external monitoring solutions (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
- **AI/ML Infrastructure**: Leveraging external AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- **Complex UI Frameworks**: Starting with CLI-first approach
- **Custom Infrastructure Operators**: Crossplane compositions handle most cases

## Data Flow

```
Developer → CLI → Kubernetes API → Crossplane → Cloud Resources
                                      ↓
                               Sync Operator → Database → External APIs → AI Agents
```

1. **Developers** interact through CLI to create platform resources
2. **Kubernetes API** receives resource definitions
3. **Crossplane** provisions actual cloud infrastructure
4. **Sync Operator** watches resources and syncs state to database
5. **External APIs** serve state data for AI agents and other consumers
